		 * Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages,
		 * you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array
		 * nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates,
		 * then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not
		 * matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
		 * 
		 * Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
		 * 
		 * Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying
		 * the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
